Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.  Dog/Cats Dataset

 Pet Population Classification (Logistic Regression)
This script implements a Logistic Regression model to classify US states as primarily "dog" or "cat" dominant based on a single feature: the dog_cat_ratio (dog population / cat population). The model is trained to identify the linear relationship between this ratio and the categorical label. A key insight is the calculation of the classification cutoff ratio, which reveals the precise threshold that the model uses to distinguish between the two classes. The evaluation includes the Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report, confirming the model's performance in this binary classification task.
